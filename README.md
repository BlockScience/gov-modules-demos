## Introduction

The Governance Modules Library (GML) is a curation of new and classic modules for governance in decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). The specifications are platform agnostic, although the implementation guidelines and examples are focused on Soroban, a Rust-based smart contract platform. The stated goal for GML is to spread best practices and innovation as well as to accelerate the adoption of Soroban as an ecosystem by providing a “batteries-included experience” — providing a complete toolkit and instructions set for enhancing DAOs and dApps governance. 

Governance Modules are templates that can be readily implemented and tuned to specific applications that depend on or require governance solutions.

This library is intended for community governance and development. As such, it contains documentation for each module as well as a Proof of Concept (PoC) through simulations.
